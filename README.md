# Predicting-Hotel-Booking-Cancellations

# Motivation
Maximising hotel revenue while preventing the pitfalls of overbooking is a complex yet critical challenge in the hospitality industry. The aim of the project is to develop an advanced classification model that accurately predicts hotel reservation cancellations. The model will enable the establishment to strategically manage reservations, effectively allocate resources, and enhance overall revenue generation :-)
